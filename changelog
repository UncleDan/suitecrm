    - Support for getting Let's Encrypt cert via IPv6 - closes #1785.
    - Refactor network interface code to ensure that it works as expected and
      supports more possible network config (e.g. hotplug interfaces & wifi).

      [Stefan Davis <stefan@turnkeylinux.org> & Jeremy Davis

  * Firstboot Initialization (inithooks):
    - Refactor start up (now hooks into getty process, rather than having it's
      own service).
      [ Stefan Davis <stefan@turnkeylinux.org> ]
    - Refactor firstboot.d/01ipconfig (and 09hostname) to ensure that hostname
      is included in dhcp info when set via inithooks.

      as turnkey-ssl). Refactor relevant scripts to leverage turnkey-ssl.
    - Refactor run script - use bashisms and general tidying.
    - Show blacklisted password characters more nicely.
    - Misc packaging changes/improvements.
    - Support returning output from MySQL - i.e. support 'SELECT'. (Only

    - Upgraded webmin to v2.0.21.
    - Removed stunnel reverse proxy (Webmin hosted directly now).
    - Ensure that Webmin uses HTTPS with default cert
      (/etc/ssl/private/cert.pem).
    - Disabled Webmin Let's Encrypt (for now).

    - Completely removed in v18.0 (Webmin now has a proper interactive shell).

    - Ported dependencies to Debian Bookworm; otherwise unchanged.

  * Security hardening & improvements:
    - Generate and use new TurnKey Bookworm keys.
    - Automate (and require) default pinning for packages from Debian
      backports. Also support non-free backports.

    - Nginx/NodeJS (NodeJS based apps only) listen on IPv6.

    - Include zstd compression support.
    - Enable new non-free-firmware apt repo by default.
    - Improve turnkey-artisan so that it works reliably in cron jobs (only
      Laravel based LAMP apps).
